    <h1>The Shock of the Natural; Works in Brooklyn Have a Long Tradition</h1>
    <h4>Oct. 5, 1999</h4>
    <br/>
    <p>
        Call them shocking, schlocky, ''sick stuff,'' profane, inane, puerile, gross, engrossing, brave, self-indulgent,
        profound or not worth the fluid they're pickled in, but the most ferociously debated art objects from the
        hand-wringing ''Sensation'' show at the Brooklyn Museum of Art have a long and hoary history behind them.
